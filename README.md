# Password_Generator_Manager
This is a command line tool to generate random passwords of given length for different services and save existing passwords as well. This tool also stores the master password in hashed form to ensure security of the user passwords. Here, I have used a simple json file to store passwords but if we use some kind of databse then it will be more secured.
